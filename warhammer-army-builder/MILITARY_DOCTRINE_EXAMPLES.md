# Military Doctrine Examples - T'au Empire Army Builder

This document demonstrates the difference between traditional Warhammer 40k army composition and the new real-world military doctrine approach.

## Scenario: Defensive Operations (2000 points)

### Traditional 40k Composition
**"Rule of Cool" / Competitive Meta Focus**

```
ARMY LIST - Traditional Approach
═══════════════════════════════════

HQ (145pts - 7.3%)
├── Commander in Crisis Battlesuit (90pts)
├── Ethereal (55pts)

ELITES (550pts - 27.5%)
├── Crisis Battlesuits (Sunforge) x3 (110pts)
├── Crisis Battlesuits (Starscythe) x3 (120pts) 
├── Crisis Battlesuits (Fireknife) x3 (115pts)
├── Stealth Battlesuits x3 (70pts)
├── Stealth Battlesuits x3 (70pts)
├── Broadside Battlesuits x1 (95pts)

TROOPS (170pts - 8.5%)
├── Strike Team x10 (85pts)
├── Strike Team x10 (85pts)

HEAVY SUPPORT (380pts - 19%)
├── Hammerhead Gunship (145pts)
├── Hammerhead Gunship (145pts)
├── Riptide Battlesuit (90pts)

FAST ATTACK (280pts - 14%)
├── Piranha x2 (70pts)
├── Pathfinders x10 (105pts)
├── Pathfinders x10 (105pts)

TOTAL: 1,525pts (475pts unused!)
```

**Problems with Traditional Approach:**
- Massive point inefficiency (475pts wasted)
- Unrealistic force structure (27.5% elites, only 8.5% troops)
- No consideration for real tactical needs
- Focus on "competitive units" regardless of mission

### Military Doctrine Approach
**Defensive Operations Doctrine**

## Scenario: Offensive Operations (2000 points)

### Military Doctrine Approach
**Combined Arms Assault Doctrine**

```

├── Stealth Suits x3 (70pts) - Advance Guard
├── Hammerhead (160pts) - Mobile Fire Support
├── Broadside Suits x1 (95pts) - Long Range Support
├── Broadside Suits x1 (90pts + equipment) - Additional Fire Support

SUPPORT ELEMENTS (240pts - 12%)
├── Piranhas x4 (240pts) - Fast Reconnaissance

TOTAL: 2000pts
```

**Key Differences in Assault Doctrine:**
- Higher armor percentage (38% vs 29% defensive)
- More mobile infantry (Breachers vs Strike Teams)
- Multiple assault elements for combined arms
- Enhanced reconnaissance for mobile operations

## Real-World Military Principles Applied

### 1. **Command Span of Control**
- **Traditional:** Often 1 HQ for entire 2000pt force
- **Doctrine:** 3-4 command elements with clear hierarchies
- **Real Analog:** Battalion/Company command structure

### 2. **Force Ratios by Mission**
```
Mission Type    | Command | Infantry | Armor | Support
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Defensive       |   9-12% |  45-60% | 20-35% | 15-25%
Assault         |  10-15% |  30-45% | 25-40% | 15-25%
Urban/Siege     |  12-18% |  40-55% | 15-30% | 20-30%
Reconnaissance  |   8-12% |  25-40% | 20-35% | 30-45%
Security        |  10-15% |  40-55% | 15-25% | 20-30%
```

### 3. **Combined Arms Integration**
- **Infantry-Armor Synergy:** Crisis Suits + Fire Warriors
- **Fire Support Coordination:** Pathfinders + Broadsides  
- **Reconnaissance Integration:** Piranhas + Stealth Suits
- **Command Control:** Multiple command nodes for complex operations

### 4. **Sustainability Factors**
- **Logistics Support:** Drones represent supply lines
- **Medical Support:** Shield drones for casualty evacuation
- **Communications:** Markerlight networks
- **Maintenance:** Technical drones and support units

## T'au-Specific Doctrine Adaptations

### 10th Edition Unit Structure Changes
**Crisis Battlesuits** now come in three fixed configurations instead of customizable loadouts:
- **Sunforge Configuration:** Burst cannon + Plasma rifle + Multi-tracker (110pts) - Anti-infantry specialist
- **Starscythe Configuration:** Cyclic ion blaster + Missile pod + Target lock (120pts) - Long-range fire support  
- **Fireknife Configuration:** Plasma rifle + Missile pod + Multi-tracker (115pts) - Versatile all-rounder

**Pathfinder Drones** are no longer standalone units - they come as equipment options with Pathfinder teams:
- Recon drone (+15pts) - Enhanced reconnaissance capability
- Grav-inhibitor drone (+20pts) - Area denial and movement control

This simplification actually supports military doctrine better by:
- **Clear Role Definition:** Each Crisis variant has a specific battlefield role
- **Realistic Equipment:** No mix-and-match weapon combinations that wouldn't exist
- **Command Simplicity:** Easier to coordinate units with standardized loadouts

### Fire Caste Organization
- **Fire Warrior Cadres** = Rifle Companies
- **Crisis Suit Teams** = Armored Fighting Vehicles
- **Pathfinder Teams** = Reconnaissance/Forward Observers
- **Commander Suits** = Command Vehicles

### Mont'ka vs Kauyon Tactics
- **Mont'ka (Killing Blow):** Higher armor ratios, assault focus
- **Kauyon (Patient Hunter):** Higher infantry ratios, defensive positions

### Subfaction Specializations
- **T'au Sept:** Balanced combined arms (doctrine standard)
- **Farsight Enclaves:** Higher battlesuit ratios (elite force)
- **Bork'an Sept:** Emphasis on fire support and long-range assets
- **Vior'la Sept:** Mobile infantry focus with rapid deployment
- **Sa'cea Sept:** Command-heavy with enhanced coordination

## Benefits of Military Doctrine System

1. **Tactical Realism:** Forces that could actually function on a battlefield
2. **Mission Adaptation:** Composition changes based on operational requirements  
3. **Educational Value:** Learn real military principles through gameplay
4. **Point Efficiency:** No more 1600-point armies when you need 2000
5. **Balanced Gameplay:** Prevents spam lists and encourages combined arms
6. **Lore Consistency:** Matches T'au military philosophy and organization

The military doctrine system transforms army building from "pick the best units" to "build a cohesive military force for a specific mission" - making both the process and the resulting armies much more interesting and realistic. 

### Real-World Military Doctrine Approach
**Emphasis: Tactical Combined Arms**
